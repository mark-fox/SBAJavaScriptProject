# Patient Manager Website

This project is the start of a management system that allows users to view the healthcare patients currently in the system and add additional patients as needed. Currently, there is no database except a simple text file that contains some dummy info for presentation purposes; however, users are able to add new entries that are included in the table.
The Dashboard page houses the table of patients. An arbitrary ID number, the patient's name, and the patient's doctor are displayed in this table. More fields could be added in other iterations, which is hinted at with the New Patient form that includes additional fields. With additional features, this table could also link to a separate page with the all the patient's info.

## Pages
- Login - validates email format and checks if input matches the stored info
- Signup - form presents fields (email, password, confirm password) for creating an account and validates the email format as well as checking passwords match
- Dashboard - displays a table of all patient entries as well as search fields (for future implementations)
- About - page for talking more about the system
- New Patient - form for entering info about a new patient and adding that info into the Dashboard

## Features
- localStorage - used to hold all the dummy entries as well as new entries
- Consistent theme - background, fonts, and colors are shared across pages
- Web Font (https://fonts.google.com/)
- Images (https://www.pexels.com/)
- Navigation bar
